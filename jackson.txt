You ever want something 
that you know you shouldn't have 
The more you know you shouldn't have it, 
The more you want it 
And then one day you get it, 
It's so good too 
But it's just like my girl 
When she's around me 
I just feel so good, so good 
But right now I just feel cold, so cold 
Right down to my bones 
'Cause ooh... 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
It's not warm when she's away 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
And she's always gone too long 
Anytime she goes away 

Wonder this time where she's gone 
Wonder if she's gone to stay 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
And this house just ain't no home 
Anytime she goes away 

I know, I know, I know, I know, 
I know, know, know, know, know, 
I know, I know, 
Hey I ought to leave 
I ought to leave her alone 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
Only darkness every day 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
And this house just ain't no home 
Anytime she goes away
Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
You don't have to worry 'cause I'm coming
Back to where I should have always stayed
And now I've heard the maybe to your story
And it's enough love for me to stay

Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at

[Chorus:]
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Anywhere you are
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Everywhere you are

[Bridge:]
Please don't close the door to our future
There's so many things we haven't tried
I could love you better than I used to
And give you all the love I have inside

[Chorus:]
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Any, any, anywhere you are
I wanna, wanna be where you are
I gotta be where you are
Oooh
Foolish of me, I couldn't see 
The forest for the trees 
You've been so true 
I've been so cruel to you 
Oh, girl please don't leave me

[Chorus:]
If you stay I'll find a way 
To erase the past 
Baby don't leave me 
Girl don't take your love from me 
Oh girl 

What can I say to make you stay 
Baby, don't leave me 
You've been so kind 
It blows my mind to know
Oh girl, I really hurt you 

[Chorus:]
Tell me girl, it's not to late 
And you give me a chance 
To make it up to you 
Don't take your love from me 
Girl don't take your love 
Don't take your love 

[Bridge:]
Girl, if you take your love away from me 
I'm gonna be in misery 
Your love is the strength that I lean upon 
How will I make it when it's gone 
Of all the little things I wanted to say.... 
...I really wanted to do
Girl , this time...
Ooh, oh girl I really mean it 

[Chorus:]
So tell me girl, it's not too late 
And you'll give me a chance 
To make it up to you 
Don't take your love from me 
Don't take your love, no no no no no
Don't take your love
Don't leave me girl 

Don't take your love from me 
Baby, don't take your love from me 
Don't take your love from me 
Oooh, don't take your love from me 
Baby, don't take your love from me
Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You persuaded me to love you
And I did
But instead of tendeness
I found heartache instead
Into your arms I fell
So unaware of the lonelyness
Thar was waiting there

[Spoken:]
You closed the door to your heart, girl
And you turned the key
Locked your love away from me

Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You said loving you
Would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love came
Into my heart
You turned and you walked
Just walked away

[Spoken:]
You stripped me of my dreams
You gave me faith, then you took my hope
Look at me now

Look at me
See what loving has done to me
Look at my face
See how cryin' has left its trace
After you made me all your own
Then you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep

[Spoken:]
My heart cries out for your tuch
But baby, you're not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air

Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
Oh oh my darling, now you're gone
Talking 'bout love, love, love, love,
Ooh ooh my darling, now you're gone
Ben, the two of us need look no more
We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own
I'll never be alone
And you my friend will see
You've got a friend in me
(You've got a friend in me) 

Ben, you're always running here and there
(Here and there) 
You feel you're not wanted anywhere
(Anywhere) 
If you ever look behind
And don't like what you find
There's something you should know
You've got a place to go
(You've got a place to go) 

I used to say "I" and "me"
Now it's "us", now it's "we"
I used to say "I" and "me"
Now it's "us", now it's "we"

Ben, most people would turn you away
I don't listen to a word they say
They don't see you as I do
I wish they would try to
I'm sure they'd think again
If they had a friend like Ben 
(A friend) 
Like Ben
(Like Ben) 
Like Ben
People... 
('Round and 'round and around...)
People make the world go 'round

They want more money but the board won't pay
People
Everybody's talkin' 'bout ecology
The air's so polluted that it's hard to breathe

But that's what makes the world go round
The ups and downs a carousel
Changing people's heads around
Go underground young men...
People make the world go round...

Old folks judge you by the clothes you wear
They'd swear you're a hippy if you have long hair
Young politicians fight for poverty
While people still cry for equality

Changing people's heads around
Go underground young men...

You better listen to me, yeah

Heartaches are callin' and tears are fallin'
Because of you, oh yeah
And when you're gone she'll know
I'm the one to go to her rescue
Maybe you didn't know that baby
You're gonna leave her one too many times
And when you come back that
Girl's gonna be mine, all mine
You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song
You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are
Some day my happy arms will hold you
And some day I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine

You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are
Some, some, some, some, day 
My happy arms will hold you
And some day I'll know that moment divine

The Girl Is Mine (Mine, Mine, Mine)
It's close to midnight and something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes,
You're paralyzed

[Chorus]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight

[2nd verse]
You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination, girl
But all the while you hear the creature creepin' up behind
You're out of time

[Chorus]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside of killer, thriller tonight

[Bridge]
Night creatures call and the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien this time
(they're open wide)
This is the end of your life

[3rd verse]
They're out to get you, there's demons closing in on every side
They will possess you unless you change the number on your dial
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close together, yeah.
All through the night I'll save you from the terror on the screen,
I'll make you see

[Chorus]
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller, chiller, thriller here tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller

I'm gonna thrill you tonight

[Rap performed by Vincent Price]
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize your neighbourhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller

[Into maniacal laugh, in deep echo]

The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (You rocked my world)

You rocked my world, you know you did (Know you did,
baby)
And everything I own I give ('Cause you rocked my
world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find (Hoo, hoo)
Someone like you to call mine

(You rocked my world)
You rocked my world, you know you did
(The way you talk to me, the way you're lovin' me)
(The way you give it to me)

You rocked my world, you know you did
(Give it to me)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah...yeah...ooh)
You rocked my world (You rocked my world), you know
you did
(You rocked my world, you rocked my world)

(Come on, girl) You rocked my world (Come on, girl),
you know you did
(Baby, baby, baby)
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
I gave you joy, your best of joy
I am the moon light, you are the spring, our life's a sacred thing
You know I always will love you, I am forever

I am the one who came when you fell down
I was the only one around (the only one around)
When things will hurt you
I am forever.

Wasn't it I who said that you are free?
Wonder if it seems so hard to be, and things would hurt you
I am forever, I am forever
We are forever, we are forever

I am a friend through thick and thin
We need each other,
We'll never part,
Our love is from the heart
We never say, "I don't need you"
We are forever

I am the one who said that you are free
When it seems so hard to be the only one
And nothing would cheer you
I am forever
Wasn't it I who carried you around?
When all the words keep turning down
When things would hurt you
I am forever, I am forever
We are forever, we are forever

You are the sun in the Southern sky, when things are shaded
Let go and then we do get back, I was the only one around
When things would hurt you
We are forever, I am forever, we are forever, I am forever
We are forever, … keep on, we are forever, … keep on, have to be strong
We are forever, we are forever, oh right
I am forever, we are forever, I am forever, we are forever, we are forever
I am forever, I am forever.
